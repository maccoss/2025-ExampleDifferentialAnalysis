# Example Python Notebook for Analyzing Data from Skyline

I use two Skyline reports for the generation of the input data:
- I use the standard Replicates report in the document grid to export meta data annotations from within the Skyline document
- I use the included `MJM Protein Total Areas.skyr` to generate the Protein Quant matrix from the document grid

I've divided my analysis into three notebooks to make it easier to find things.

## 1-import-skyline-output.ipynb
**Data Import and Processing Pipeline**

This notebook handles the initial data import and processing from Skyline outputs:

- **Data Loading**: Imports protein quantitation matrix and sample metadata from CSV files
- **Protein Parsing**: Extracts UniProt accession numbers from complex protein identifiers using regex patterns
- **Sample Name Cleaning**: Removes common prefixes/suffixes and normalizes sample naming conventions
- **Metadata Integration**: Links quantitation data with experimental metadata (groups, conditions, etc.)
- **Data Quality Assessment**: 
  - Visualizes missing data patterns across samples and proteins
  - Creates summary statistics for protein detection frequency
  - Generates group-wise sample counts and completeness metrics
- **Data Structure Creation**: Prepares cleaned datasets for downstream normalization and analysis
- **Visualization**: Creates comprehensive plots showing data completeness, sample groupings, and protein detection patterns

**Key Features:**
- Robust protein identifier parsing for various database formats
- Flexible sample naming cleanup with configurable patterns
- Comprehensive data quality reporting
- Exports cleaned data structures for subsequent notebooks

## 2-normalize-data.ipynb
**Data Normalization and Quality Control**

This notebook performs comprehensive data normalization and quality assessment:

### **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
- Imports processed data from the first notebook with output suppression for clean execution
- Creates log2-transformed data for visualization and analysis

### **Quality Assessment Visualizations**
- **Box plots** of raw protein abundances by individual replicate
- **Group-wise comparison** plots with color-coded experimental groups
- **Distribution analysis** of protein intensities across samples

### **Normalization Methods**
1. **Median Normalization**
   - Divides each sample by its median, then multiplies by global median
   - Maintains original data scale while correcting for loading differences
   - Simple and robust method for systematic bias correction

2. **Variance Stabilizing Normalization (VSN)**
   - Implements true VSN using arcsinh (inverse hyperbolic sine) transformation
   - **Method**: `transformed = arcsinh(a * intensity + b)` where parameters are optimized for variance stabilization
   - **Purpose**: Reduces the dependency of variance on mean intensity (heteroscedasticity)
   - **Implementation**: Uses either optimized parameters (via scipy.optimize) or quantile-based parameter estimation
   - **Effect**: Stabilizes variance across the entire intensity range, improving downstream statistical analysis

### **Comparative Analysis**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on original, median-normalized, and VSN-transformed data
- **Correlation analysis** of control samples to assess normalization effectiveness
- **Hierarchical clustering** of control groups to validate biological vs. technical variation
- **Variance stabilization assessment** comparing coefficient of variation across intensity ranges

### **Control Sample Analysis**
- **Pattern-based control identification** (configurable patterns for different control types)
- **Correlation heatmaps** with hierarchical clustering for quality assessment
- **Within-group vs. between-group correlation analysis** to evaluate normalization success
- **Group separation metrics** to quantify biological signal preservation

### **VSN Implementation References**
The VSN normalization implementation is based on the following methodology:
- **Huber, W. et al. (2002)** "Variance stabilization applied to microarray data calibration and to the quantification of differential expression." *Bioinformatics* 18(suppl_1): S96-S104.
- **Durbin, B.P. et al. (2002)** "A variance-stabilizing transformation for gene-expression microarray data." *Bioinformatics* 18(suppl_1): S105-S110.

The arcsinh transformation used here provides similar variance stabilization properties to the original VSN method, with the advantage of being parameter-free and computationally efficient for proteomics data.

**Key Features:**
- Two complementary normalization approaches for different analysis needs
- Comprehensive quality control visualizations
- Automated control sample analysis with configurable patterns
- Statistical assessment of normalization effectiveness
- Exports normalized datasets for differential analysis

These analyses provide a comprehensive workflow for differential proteomics analysis, from raw Skyline outputs to publication-ready results. The notebooks are designed to be modular, allowing researchers to adapt individual components to their specific experimental needs.
